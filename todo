+ fix stock-balance-loading
- change repositories to services inside controllers
- load v_label on read


STATS:
  - Model:
    - MvtProductStockRepository:
      - readSumByDate(dateMin, dateMax, idSubcategory)
    
    - MvtProductStockService:
      - readDailyChartModel(dateMin, dateMax, idSubcategory)

  - View:
    - /stock/chart:
      - Filter(date-min, date-max, id-subcategory, id-category?)
      - Chart(x: localdate, y: quantity, name: product-name)
      // maybe add some unit for the product model so that it can be used as a filter ?

  - Controller:
    - MctProductStockController:
      - chart(dateMin, dateMax, idSubcategory)


- only choose date with existing data
- group chart by subcategory (maybe make multiple choice)
- make chart by week and by month per year
- client
- facture
- make all view access json if possible, or use dto instead
